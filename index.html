        <h1>Outstanding K-12. In the neighborhood</h1>
        <p>GROWCommunity is a community-wide effort to develop a seamless neighborhood PreK-12 system on Chicago’s North Side. Anchored by Lake View and Amundsen high schools and the public and parochial elementary schools that feed into them, GrowCommunity will work to ensure that every neighborhood option is a quality one. The University of Chicago Urban Education Institute (UEI) has partnered with the initiative to launch and accelerate ongoing school improvement efforts.</p>

<p>The effort is guided by an Advisory Task Force composed of neighborhood aldermen, school and parent leaders, community members, and UChicago’s Urban Education Institute. </p>

<p>GrowCommunity’s partnership with UEI includes a multi-phased commitment involving supports around the 5Essentials diagnostic assessment of school effectiveness, already in use by all CPS schools, incorporation of a college-going and attainment curriculum, proven literacy improvement systems for elementary schools to opt into, and additional outreach and communications support to align resources, sustain progress, and reach student attainment goals.</p>

	<h3>Why Neighborhood Schools?</h3>
	
	<p>
	Great school systems anchor great communities. Everyone benefits when public schools excel and prepare students to suceed not only in high school, but also in college and beyond. Thriving schools lead to an engaged commmunity, increased property values, a stabilized tax base, and increased revenue in business districts.</p>
	
	<p>For students in those schools, quality education leads to higher wages, lower crime, greater civic participation, and more economic stability.</p>
